# SAE921-GRP4100-CPlusPlus-Class-SStyles

This is a game project created for the SAE Game programming courses.

During this project, students have to study basic operations from the iostream library like std::cout and std::cin
and use them with logical operators(+=*/-%) and conditions (if, for, while...do) to accomplish dice games.
The studied language is C++.

DiceGame_001 is a simple dice game where the player has to enter his name, chose to play or exit and then wish for the best!
