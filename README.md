# SAE921-GRP4100-CPlusPlus-Class-SStyles

This is a game project created for the SAE Game programming courses.

During this project, students have to study basic operations from the <iostream> library like std::cout and std::cin
and use them with logical operators and conditions (if, for, while...) to accomplish dice games.

The language in which it is developed is C++.
